Hi, welcome to my homepage. I am Alvin Zhou, a Ph.D. candidate (track: digital media and social networks) in the [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am advised by [Sandra González-Bailón](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/sandra-gonzález-bailón-phd).

I conduct theory-driven computational social science research on political communication and strategic communication. You can find my published work in venues such as *Journal of Communication*, *Computers in Human Behavior*, and *Public Relations Review*. My other academic and journalistic writing has appeared in *Journal of Communication*, *Information, Communication & Society*, and *Vista Story*.

I recently graduated from the [Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu) with a dual Master in Statistics, focusing on the causal inference framework and statistical learning methods. I obtained my M.A. in Strategic Public Relations from the [Annenberg School](https://annenberg.usc.edu) at the University of Southern California, supervised by [Aimei Yang](https://annenberg.usc.edu/faculty/journalism/aimei-yang). I hold dual bachelor’s degrees (B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering & B.A. in Journalism) from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018/index.html).

I am the group coordinator of the [DiMeNet](https://dimenet.asc.upenn.edu) research group, where I work for a NSF grant that is developing network measures for digital news consumption. I am also active in the [DIG](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/research-centers/democracy-information-group) research group, where I am collaborating with [Yphtach Lelkes](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/yphtach-lelkes-phd) and [Kokil Jaidka](http://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/cnmkj/) on several studies that explore the role of affordances in human communication. Using big datasets, simulation, and network analysis, I am also advancing theories that were previously established by case studies and surveys in strategic communication. This series of work have won a Robert Heath Award and a Top Faculty Paper Award at ICA, and two Top Student Paper Awards at NCA.

I was a communication practitioner before entering the academia. Between 2014 and 2016, I was a reporter and later on a freelance writer at [Vista Story](https://weibo.com/vistastory). I have also worked for BlueFocus Communication Group as a public relations consultant, and for China Central Television and Xinhua News Agency as a reporter.
